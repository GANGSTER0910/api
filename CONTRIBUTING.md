We value your participation in this open source project.

You can contribute to the project in the following ways:

- If you have ideas or suggestions for APIs that could benefit the dev community and make their life easier, raise a new issue and start working on the PR after discussion.
- You can also suggest improvements to existing APIs. Just raise an issue and start working on the PR after discussion.
- You can also improve the Swagger documentation that is auto-generated by FastAPI by learning how to do so in the code. Refer to FastAPI docs. Just raise an issue and start working on the PR after discussion.
- All API data and core logic resides in the [foss42/foss42-core](https://github.com/foss42/foss42-core) project. So, you can add new data (eg: Some specific data pertaining to a country) or improve the API logic.
